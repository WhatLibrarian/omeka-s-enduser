# Activity Log

The [Activity Log module](https://omeka.org/s/modules/activitylog/){target=_blank} allows you to gather information about changes made in the Omeka interface into one table. The module will show all changes made to resources, sites, installation settings, users, and module-added data points.

Once activated on the [modules](index.md) tab of the admin dashboard, Activity Log has no required settings. It adds an entry to the Modules list in the left-hand sidebar, which takes users to the table of events. 

Activity Log is only accessible to users at the Global Admin and Supervisor levels. Only Global Admin can erase Activity Log data.  

## Viewing events

Activity Log will record events when it is active. The table will reflect all changes made in the installation, by all users. An event can be seen in more detail by clicking the "View event data" link in each table entry. This will open the right-hand drawer to show a technical version of the data saved to the database in the event.

Users with permission to view the Activity Log can filter events for easier viewing.
