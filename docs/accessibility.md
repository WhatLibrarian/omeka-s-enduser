# Accessibility Statement

The Omeka team is committed to making Omeka S an accessible option for building collections and exhibits online. We are working to make the core code accessible and will continue to make accessibility for persons with disabilities a priority as we develop the code. Omeka strives to adhere to [W3C web design standards](http://www.w3.org/standards/){target=_blank} and to be compliant with [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/){target=_blank} of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

## Front end (Public view)

The Omeka S themes produced by the Omeka team have the following features to improve accessibility:

-   [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria){target=_blank} (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks for tabbing through page content, when not using a mouse or using a screen reader.
-   Semantic HTML5 markup.

Please note that although the core code for Omeka S conform to the above standards, installations of Omeka S which have been customized or which are using non-RRCHNM modules and themes may lack some or all of these options. While we encourage developers to consider accessibility, we cannot guarantee that their code includes ARIA Landmarks, SkipNav, or other accessibility considerations.

## Back end (Administrative view)

The administrative dashboard of Omeka S has the following features for accessibility:

-   ARIA landmarks for screen readers on the Admin Dashboard, designating the header, navigation, main content, and footers.
-   Semantic HTML5 markup.
